# ShortBNF üìñ:  The BNF...but just the important safety information

No need to guess which drug monographs have the important safety information section to prepare for the pre-registration exam! 
<br>

This app is a compressed version of the BNF, containing only the names of the drugs that have the extra important safety information as well as its contents.

### Stuff I learned while making this ‚úçÔ∏è:
- React: useState, useEffect hooks
- Introduced to basic styling using Tailwind CSS
- How to link front and backend components using Flask API
